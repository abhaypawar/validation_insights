## **15. Edge and Negative Testing**
   - **Extreme Boundary Conditions**:
     - Running tests on the maximum or minimum allowable data (e.g., max storage usage, high network latency, low battery).
   - **Negative Testing**:
     - Purposefully inputting incorrect or unexpected data to assess how well the app manages errors and exceptions.
   - **Tip**: For networking, simulate 2G/3G/4G drops to test how gracefully the app reconnects and resumes operations.

## **16. AI-Powered Testing Strategies**
