### Part 2: Mock Interviews

Mock interviews are essential for solidifying technical knowledge, building confidence, and refining your answers for this role. Let’s break down the technical focus areas:

#### 1. Scripting: Focus on Python and Shell Scripting for Automation

Prepare to discuss automation scripting, error handling, logging, and efficiency in your code. Below are sample scenarios with code examples to help you get comfortable:

**Example 1: Automation Script for Running Tests on Multiple GPUs**

```python
import subprocess

# List of GPUs or test cases
gpus = ["gpu1", "gpu2", "gpu3"]

for gpu in gpus:
    print(f"Running test on {gpu}")
    result = subprocess.run(["test_tool", "--gpu", gpu], capture_output=True)
    if result.returncode == 0:
        print(f"Test passed on {gpu}")
    else:
        print(f"Test failed on {gpu}: {result.stderr}")
```

**Scenario Discussion Points**:
- **Why Subprocess**: Explain how this script automates testing across GPUs and captures the output for error handling.
- **Error Handling**: Be ready to discuss how you handle errors and log results, as it’s crucial for automation scripts.
- **Efficiency**: Mention potential improvements, like parallel execution to save time when testing multiple configurations.

**Example 2: Log Parsing in Shell for Quick Issue Diagnosis**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Example log file
log_file="build_log.txt"

# Check for common errors
grep -i "error" $log_file | while read -r line; do
    echo "Error found: $line"
done
```

**Key Concepts**:
- Discuss how the above code identifies errors in a build log.
- Be prepared to explain **shell commands like `grep`** and demonstrate how you can modify this to capture other critical information.

#### 2. Build Systems: Discuss Makefile and CMake Basics

Since the role requires familiarity with Android and Windows build systems, practice explaining how **Makefiles** and **CMake** simplify and automate builds.

**Sample Makefile**:
```makefile
# Simple Makefile for a C++ project

TARGET = my_app
SRC = main.cpp utils.cpp
OBJ = $(SRC:.cpp=.o)

$(TARGET): $(OBJ)
	g++ -o $(TARGET) $(OBJ)

%.o: %.cpp
	g++ -c $< -o $@

clean:
	rm -f $(TARGET) $(OBJ)
```

**Makefile Discussion Points**:
- **Explain Dependencies**: The `SRC` and `OBJ` variables help organize source and object files. Discuss how this setup allows for incremental builds.
- **Targets**: Be prepared to explain each target, especially `clean`, which is a common practice for build cleanup.
- **Efficiency and Modularity**: Mention that Makefiles help with modularity and scalability, critical for large projects like those at Qualcomm.

**CMake Basics**:
CMake is often used in cross-platform projects. Here’s a simple example to illustrate configuration.

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)

# Set the project name
project(MyProject)

# Add an executable
add_executable(MyProject main.cpp utils.cpp)
```

**CMake Discussion Points**:
- Explain how **CMakeLists.txt** serves as a centralized configuration file.
- Discuss **cross-platform builds** and why CMake is preferred for complex projects.

#### 3. Testing Automation Scenarios

Here’s a sample scenario you might encounter in the interview:

**Scenario**:
"Suppose you’re tasked with verifying a GPU driver update across multiple devices. How would you approach this?"

**Example Answer**:
- **Test Planning**: Define test cases, such as rendering benchmarks, stress tests, and compatibility tests with various graphics APIs (like OpenGL and Vulkan).
- **Automation Setup**: Use Python or shell scripts to deploy the driver update across test devices, run predefined tests, and capture results.
- **Error Logging and Reporting**: Implement detailed logging for each test, focusing on issues like rendering errors, performance drops, or system crashes.
- **Performance Comparison**: Write scripts to compare performance data between the new and old driver versions, helping to quantify improvements or regressions.

#### 4. Discussing Past Projects and Experiences

### Sample Questions and Answers for Mock Interviews

**Q1: What is the role of CI/CD in a multi-platform environment, especially for testing automation?**
- **Sample Answer**: “CI/CD ensures code is continuously integrated and tested across platforms, catching errors early and reducing manual effort. In a multi-platform setup, CI/CD helps verify compatibility and performance on each OS, using automation to deploy builds, run tests, and provide reports. This is especially important for graphics drivers and compilers that must be compatible across devices.”

**Q2: Describe a time when you developed or improved a test automation process.**
- **Sample Answer**: “In my previous role, I identified redundancies in our test automation scripts that led to long runtimes. By modularizing the scripts and adding conditional test execution, I reduced test time by 30%. This change helped our team deliver faster results and reallocate resources to other critical testing areas.”

**Q3: How would you approach debugging a failing shader in a GPU testing environment?**
- **Sample Answer**: “I’d start by isolating the issue by reviewing shader compilation logs, checking for syntax errors, and ensuring compliance with GPU API standards. Then, I’d use debugging tools like RenderDoc to capture frames and analyze each rendering stage, looking for anomalies in texture mapping, lighting, or color. If it’s a performance issue, I’d look at memory usage and rendering time per frame.”
