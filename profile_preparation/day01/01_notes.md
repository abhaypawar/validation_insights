### 1. Testing Methodology and Processes

#### Test Plan Development
A **test plan** is a document that outlines the strategy, objectives, resources, and schedule of intended test activities. For a Graphics Compiler Test Engineer, here’s how you’d approach it:

**Sections of a Test Plan**:
1. **Scope and Objective**:
   - Define the purpose: "To validate GPU compiler functionality, efficiency, and compatibility."
   - Define test objectives, like checking that shaders render correctly across devices and that optimizations do not alter rendering.

2. **Requirements Collection**:
   - Break down requirements into functional (e.g., shader compatibility) and non-functional (e.g., low power consumption) aspects.
   - Capture performance metrics, such as FPS or GPU power usage targets.

3. **Types of Test Cases**:
   - **Unit Tests**: Test isolated components of the compiler.
   - **Integration Tests**: Verify interactions between components, like optimization stages.
   - **System Tests**: Validate end-to-end compiler functionality with graphics rendering on hardware.

4. **Sample Test Case**:
   ```json
   {
     "Test Case ID": "TC_GPU_Compiler_01",
     "Title": "Shader Compilation Verification",
     "Description": "Verify that basic GLSL shader compiles successfully and renders correctly.",
     "Preconditions": "GLSL shader source available.",
     "Steps": [
       "1. Load shader in the compiler.",
       "2. Compile the shader.",
       "3. Deploy compiled shader on target device.",
       "4. Observe and capture rendered output."
     ],
     "Expected Result": "Shader renders with no artifacts or visual distortions.",
     "Pass/Fail Criteria": "Rendered output matches expected visual."
   }
   ```

#### Verification Techniques in Compilers and Graphics Environments

1. **Differential Testing**:
   - This involves running the same shader on different compiler versions and comparing outputs.
   - For instance, you could use `diff` on two compiled outputs or render images to see differences.

2. **Golden Testing**:
   - Here’s a basic Python script to compare two rendered images pixel by pixel to identify differences:
   ```python
   from PIL import Image, ImageChops

   def compare_images(img1_path, img2_path):
       img1 = Image.open(img1_path)
       img2 = Image.open(img2_path)
       diff = ImageChops.difference(img1, img2)
       if diff.getbbox():
           return "Images are different"
       return "Images are identical"

   result = compare_images("golden_output.png", "test_output.png")
   print(result)
   ```
   - This script checks for pixel-level differences, useful for validating rendering accuracy.

3. **Performance and Power Testing**:
   - Use profiling tools to log metrics, like GPU usage or frame rate.
   - For automated testing, use timers in scripts to measure execution time:
   ```python
   import time

   start = time.time()
   # Run the test shader
   end = time.time()
   print("Execution time:", end - start, "seconds")
   ```

4. **Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing**:
   - Run the compiled shader on an actual device and capture outputs through APIs or logging frameworks.

**Quick Revision Summary for Interview**:
- **Differential Testing**: Compares outputs across compiler versions.
- **Golden Testing**: Matches output against a "golden" reference.
- **Performance Testing**: Validates efficiency in execution time, memory, and power.
- **Hardware-in-the-Loop**: Testing on real hardware to ensure practical viability.

### 2. Automation Frameworks and Scripting Languages

For this role, **Python** is a strong choice for automation due to its simplicity and library support. Here’s a quick guide to cover the basics you need:

#### Python Automation Scripting Basics
1. **File Handling**:
   - Example for reading shader files:
     ```python
     with open("shader.glsl", "r") as file:
         shader_code = file.read()
         print(shader_code)
     ```

2. **Automating Command Line Execution**:
   - To automate compiler commands:
     ```python
     import subprocess

     def run_command(command):
         result = subprocess.run(command, shell=True, capture_output=True, text=True)
         print("Output:", result.stdout)
         print("Error:", result.stderr)

     run_command("glslc shader.glsl -o shader.spv")
     ```

3. **Basic Data Management for Test Results**:
   - Use dictionaries and lists for data handling:
     ```python
     test_results = []

     test_results.append({"test_case": "TC1", "status": "pass", "duration": "5ms"})
     for result in test_results:
         print(result)
     ```

**Tips**:
- Use libraries like `unittest` or `pytest` to structure tests more formally.
- Capture outputs and log results for easier debugging and traceability.

### 3. Tools: Git, Make, CMake, MS Build, JIRA, and Perforce

Here’s an overview of each tool, tailored for use in testing and build automation:

#### Git
- **Common Commands**:
  - `git clone <repo-url>`: Clone a repository.
  - `git commit -m "message"`: Commit changes.
  - `git branch <branch-name>`: Create a new branch.
  - `git merge <branch-name>`: Merge branches.

**Tip**: Familiarize yourself with `git diff` and `git log` to review code changes, which is essential for testing bug fixes or regressions.

#### Make and CMake
- **Makefile Basics**:
  ```Makefile
  all: compile

  compile:
      gcc main.c -o main

  clean:
      rm -f main
  ```
- **CMake for Cross-Platform Build**:
  ```cmake
  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
  project(ExampleProject)

  add_executable(main main.cpp)
  ```

**Tip**: Learn how to define custom targets for different configurations (debug/release builds), as this is common in compiler testing.

#### MS Build (for Windows)
- Use MS Build for automating Windows builds in Visual Studio:
  ```shell
  MSBuild.exe solution.sln /p:Configuration=Release
  ```

#### JIRA
- **Core JIRA Tasks**:
  - **Creating Tickets**: Document bugs, features, or tasks with clear details and acceptance criteria.
  - **Updating Status**: Use boards to track progress.

**Tip**: Practice writing concise, clear bug descriptions and include test cases or logs if applicable.

#### Perforce
- Similar to Git but designed for larger, enterprise-grade repositories.
- **Basic Commands**:
  - `p4 sync`: Sync workspace with server.
  - `p4 submit -d "description"`: Commit changes.
